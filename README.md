# Trucking Logistics Management System

## Overview

This project simulates a **Trucking Logistics Management System** designed to manage the interaction between truck owners, drivers, and customers. The application is built using **Next.js** and features **NextAuth** for user authentication via Google OAuth 2.0. It fetches data from a simulated backend powered by **JSON Server** and leverages **React Query** for efficient data handling.

The goal is to provide a user-friendly and responsive single-page application where users can manage trucks, drivers, and orders effectively.
